                                <h4>How long do cosmetic dental results last?</h4>
                                <p>With proper care, porcelain veneers can last 10-15 years, professional whitening lasts 1-3 years, and cosmetic bonding typically lasts 3-10 years depending on oral hygiene and lifestyle factors.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Is cosmetic dentistry painful?</h4>
                                <p>Most cosmetic procedures are minimally invasive and cause little to no discomfort. We offer sedation options for patients with dental anxiety or for more extensive treatments.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Can cosmetic work be done on sensitive teeth?</h4>
                                <p>Yes, we often address tooth sensitivity as part of cosmetic treatment. Many procedures actually help reduce sensitivity by protecting exposed tooth surfaces.</p>

                                <h4>What's the difference between crowns and fillings?</h4>
                                <p>Fillings are used for smaller areas of decay, while crowns cover the entire visible portion of a tooth. Crowns are recommended when more than 50% of the tooth structure is damaged.</p>
                                
                                <h4>How long do restorations last?</h4>
                                <p>Composite fillings typically last 5-10 years, while crowns and bridges can last 15-20 years or more with proper care and regular dental checkups.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Are tooth-colored fillings as strong as metal?</h4>
                                <p>Modern composite materials are very durable and suitable for most situations. For large restorations in back teeth, we may recommend porcelain or gold for maximum strength.</p>

                        <p>Our implant services include single tooth replacement, multiple tooth replacement, and full arch reconstruction. We use premium titanium implants that integrate with your jawbone for maximum stability.</p>
                        
                        <p>The implant process involves careful planning using 3D imaging, precise surgical placement, and custom crown fabrication. Most patients find the procedure more comfortable than they expected, especially with our sedation options.</p>

                                <h4>Am I a good candidate for implants?</h4>
                                <p>Most adults with adequate bone density and healthy gums are candidates. We'll evaluate your specific situation during a comprehensive consultation, including digital X-rays and 3D imaging.</p>
                                
                                <h4>How long does the implant process take?</h4>
                                <p>The complete process typically takes 3-6 months, allowing time for the implant to integrate with your jawbone. Immediate temporary teeth can often be provided.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Do implants require special care?</h4>
                                <p>Implants are maintained just like natural teeth with regular brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings. They don't decay, but the surrounding gum tissue needs to stay healthy.</p>

                                <p>Aligners should be worn 20-22 hours per day for optimal results. They can be removed for eating, drinking, brushing, and special occasions.</p>

                                <p>With mild sedation (nitrous oxide), you'll be relaxed but aware. With deeper sedation, most patients have little to no memory of the procedure.</p>

                                <p>You'll need someone to drive you home after oral or IV sedation. With nitrous oxide, the effects wear off quickly and you can typically drive yourself home.</p>
