                            <div class="treatment-details">
                                <p>Invisalign revolutionizes orthodontic treatment by using a series of custom-made, virtually invisible aligners to gradually move your teeth into their ideal positions. Unlike traditional braces, Invisalign aligners are removable, comfortable, and nearly undetectable.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Clinical Benefits</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Predictable Results:</strong> Advanced 3D imaging technology allows us to show you your future smile before treatment begins</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Oral Health:</strong> Removable aligners make brushing and flossing easier, reducing risk of decay and gum disease</li>
                                    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Smooth plastic aligners eliminate the irritation and emergency visits often associated with traditional braces</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lifestyle Compatibility:</strong> Remove aligners for important meetings, special occasions, or when playing contact sports</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Treatment Process</h3>

                        <h2>Porcelain Veneers</h2>
                        <div class="treatment-content">
                            <div class="treatment-details">
                                <p>Porcelain veneers are ultra-thin shells of medical-grade ceramic that are bonded to the front surfaces of teeth to create a stunning, natural-looking smile. They can address multiple cosmetic concerns simultaneously while preserving maximum tooth structure.</p>
                                
                                <h3>What Veneers Can Address</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Discolored or stained teeth that don't respond to whitening</li>
                                    <li>Chipped, cracked, or worn teeth</li>
                                    <li>Gaps between teeth</li>
                                    <li>Slightly crooked or misshapen teeth</li>
                                    <li>Teeth that appear too small or disproportionate</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>The Veneer Advantage</h3>
                                <p>Modern porcelain veneers are incredibly durable, stain-resistant, and can last 15-20 years with proper care. They reflect light similar to natural tooth enamel, creating a beautiful, lifelike appearance that enhances your entire smile.</p>

                        <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                        <div class="treatment-content">
                            <div class="treatment-details">
                                <p>Dental implants represent the gold standard for tooth replacement, providing a permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions like natural teeth. Unlike bridges or dentures, implants stimulate the jawbone to prevent bone loss and maintain facial structure.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Implant Components</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Titanium Implant:</strong> Surgically placed in the jawbone, acts as an artificial tooth root</li>
                                    <li><strong>Abutment:</strong> Connects the implant to the crown, providing a stable foundation</li>
                                    <li><strong>Crown:</strong> Custom-fabricated to match your natural teeth in color, shape, and size</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Long-term Benefits</h3>
                                <p>Implants can last a lifetime with proper care, preserve adjacent healthy teeth (unlike bridges), and maintain bone health. They provide the confidence to eat, speak, and smile without worry about shifting or discomfort.</p>
